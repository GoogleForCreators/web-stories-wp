# imgareaselect

ImgAreaSelect is a jQuery plugin for selecting a rectangular area of an image. This is a fork of the original jQuery [plugin](https://github.com/odyniec/imgareaselect), as [patched by WordPress core](https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/blob/2382765afa36e10bf3c74420024ad4e85763a47c/src/js/_enqueues/vendor/imgareaselect/jquery.imgareaselect.js), with [one additional bugfix](https://github.com/odyniec/imgareaselect/issues/71#issuecomment-404979992).
