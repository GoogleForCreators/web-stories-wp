 * Focus styles are handled in helpers/outline because our focus style is a border it needs to have consistent spacing around it, which means a transparent border when not focused.
 * Having this override be in a global style will add confusion when spacing isn't lining up how developers think it should in their given component.
 * When helper is not used, default outline style will still show up to preserve accessibility.
