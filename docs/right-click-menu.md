## Technical notes and considerations

### Copying and pasting styles

When a user right clicks elements, they may be given the option to copy an element's styles and paste them to another element of the same type.

**Note**: This does not override all styles of the element. Only styles that are in the table below are able to be copied and pasted:

|Element type|Properties that are copy/paste-able|
|--|--|
|Text|- `backgroundColor`<br/>- `backgroundTextMode`<br/>- `border`<br/>- `border-radius`<br/>- `flip`<br/>- `font`<br/>- `fontSize`<br/>- `lineHeight`<br/>- `opacity`<br/>- `padding`<br/>- `rotationAngle`<br/>- `textAlign`|
|Foreground Media|- `border`<br/>- `border-radius`<br/>- `flip`<br/>- `opacity`<br/>- `overlay`<br/>- `rotationAngle`|
|Shape|- `backgroundColor`<br/>- `flip`<br/>- `opacity`<br/>- `rotationAngle`|

A user may copy styles from any text, foreground media, and shape element. A user may not copy background media element styles.

Once styles are copied, a user may select an element of the same type and 'paste' those onto the selected element. The selected element's properties will be overridden by the 'copied' styles.

### Testing 

In order to prevent regression testing, unit and karma tests have been created. It is recommended to add a karma test for each new right click action to make sure that it behaves properly.
