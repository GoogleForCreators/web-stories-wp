# Browser and device support

We support roughly the same set of browsers as the AMP Project to align with the AMP story runtime, with additional form factor limitations. In practice, this means:

* The latest **two versions of all major browsers** (currently Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari and Opera)
* We support **desktop & tablet versions** of these respective browsers
* We accept fixes for all browsers with market share greater than 1 percent

**Internet Explorer** is explicitly **not** supported.
