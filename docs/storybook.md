# Storybook

A living components library is maintained using [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/).

The latest version of the project's storybook can be found at [https://google.github.io/web-stories-wp/](https://google.github.io/web-stories-wp/).

To run it locally, use the following command:

```bash
npm run storybook
```

In addition to the components library, the storybook also contains a story editor "playground" that can be used to test-drive the editor.
