# Performance

Performance for the editor follows the [RAIL model](https://web.dev/rail/). Most of our in app interactions will be categorized by the [Animation](https://web.dev/rail/#animation:-produce-a-frame-in-10-ms) & [Response](https://web.dev/rail/#response:-process-events-in-under-50ms) section of this model. 

It's important to measure the performance of the app with the react production build (`npm run build`) in an incognito window. This imitates what a user will experience and will prevent any chrome extensions from effecting performance times. It's also important to be aware of what machine you're auditing the app on relative to the user base of the application. An M1 macbook pro can perform about twice as fast as an intel macbook pro. This is something you should account for when trying to compare or justify results.

## Existing Performance Work

To view any prior performance PRs, just search github pulls and issues for anything with the `performance` tag.

The two main milestone audits exist here:

- [Performance Report: January 2022 ](https://github.com/GoogleForCreators/web-stories-wp/issues/10158)
- [Performance Report: April 2022](https://github.com/GoogleForCreators/web-stories-wp/issues/11263)

## Chrome DevTools Performance Tab vs React Profiler

To identify a performance bottleneck in the application, you should use the chrome devtools performance tab in an incognito window, record a sample interaction, and see if it violates the RAIL Model. If there is a violation of the RAIL Model, you should use React Profiler on the development build to guide your architectural decisions.

**Note:** Performance optimizations can often come at the cost of Legibility & Maintainability. They can often also be footguns for performance if used incorrectly. It's important to have documentable proof of a performance bottleneck before altering code for the sake of performance improvements.

### React Profiler

The React Profiler is beneficial for identifying where and how you can make the application more performant. Once you've recorded an interaction within the application, you can audit the commits and component renders of the application for that interaction.

There are essentially two things to look for when auditing a flame graph in the React Profiler, extraneous renders & expensive renders.

#### Extraneous Renders

Extraneous renders are categorized as renders that occur, that don't need to, for a particular update. You can think about these the difference between what React diffs for a particular update, and the minimum that needs to be diffed for our UI to visually update for a user. This difference is an extraneous render.

There's no need to eliminate all extraneous renders, but it is important to be able to identify, and remove, areas that have large amounts of extraneous renders. The classic example within the context of this app is updating an element. If we have 50 elements on a story page, and update the position of 1 element, only 1 element needs a visual update for the user. However, if all 50 elements re-render, and 49 of them are empty re-renders (re-render where nothing actually updated), those 49 re-renders are extraneous re-renders that should be eliminated.

There are many approaches to eliminate empty re-renders. The use case and existing architecture will dictate whatever approach you take, but ultimately any approach that is verified with the react flame graph should work.

Here is a great article to reference: [When Does React Render Your Component?](https://www.zhenghao.io/posts/react-rerender)

#### Expensive Renders

Expensive renders are components that show up in the react flame graph and take >1ms to re-render. Like extraneous renders, this is not a hard rule, but you should look for components that are eating up a significant amount of your response budget when you identify a bottleneck.

Once expensive renders are identified in the flame graph from the React Profiling tool, recording the same interaction in the Chrome Dev Tools Performance tab, then inspecting the callstack is best to identify calls are making the components render expensive.

## Using Context Performantly

All of our context is held using the [use-context-selector](https://github.com/dai-shi/use-context-selector) package, and we have a small layer around it that allows it to use shallow equality vs referencial equality to detect if a component should re-render based on the return value of its selector. You can see this code in `packages/react/src/useContextSelector.js`.

As a general rule of thumb, it is best practice to pull only essential data needed for your component through a selector when using `useContextSelector(...)`. This practice helps eliminate empty/extraneous renders induced from context. [Read more about it here](https://github.com/GoogleForCreators/web-stories-wp/issues/2662#issuecomment-1011372651).

## Main Areas to Identify Performance Regressions

There is always a chance for performance regressions as features get altered and added. The main regression to watch out for in the story editor is where a component is rendered for every element in state. Examples of this include the Display Layer, the Frames Layer, the Layer Panel. It should be verified that not every instance of said component re-renders when only one or a few of those element components needs updating. All these components are prone to large performance regressions if hooks or props pass data around unwisely.

It would be beneficial to audit these components from time to time in the react profiler. An audit can be as simple as recording an update to selection, or updating the position of a single element. If the react flame graph indicates that this is causing every element to re-render vs only the effected elements, a large performance regression has occured.

Be sure to check for this regression on PRs that effect display elements, frame elements, layers in the layers panel, or any story state hooks.
