# Integration Layer

Similar to the editor, the Dashboard can be integrated by configuring the `Dashboard` and other components like `InterfaceSkeleton`.

As seen in the [Getting Started](./getting-started.md) guide, a minimal dashboard can be created by using the two main components  `Dashboard` and `InterfaceSkeleton`  like below.

```js
import { Dashboard, InterfaceSkeleton } from "@googleforcreators/dashboard";

const StoriesDashboard = () => {
  const apiCallbacks = {
    fetchStories: () =>
      Promise.resolve({
        stories: {},
        fetchedStoryIds: [],
        totalPages: 1,
        totalStoriesByStatus: {
          all: 0,
          publish: 0,
        },
      }),
  };

  return (
    <Dashboard config={{ apiCallbacks }}>
      <InterfaceSkeleton />
    </Dashboard>
  );
};

export default StoriesDashboard;
```
