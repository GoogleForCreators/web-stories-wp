# API Callbacks

Side effects are added to the Dashboard by defining callbacks. One such callback is `fetchStories` which is used to get stories from the backend and is the only required callback.
Other callbacks can be used to add or handle functionalities for story management.

All API callbacks are asynchronous and should eventually resolve to their corresponding expected responses.

Below is a list of available API callbacks categorized in different sections.

Note that when the "Use template" button is clicked, it internally needs to know the registered element types.
Therefore, you need to register them using `elementTypes.forEach(registerElementType)` in the same way as 
it is done for the editor itself (see [Getting Started](./../story-editor/getting-started.md)).
