/**
 * Move element in element order on the current page (optionally handle group id when moved in the Layers Panel).
 *
 * If no element is given, check if selection only has one element, and if so, use that.
 * If no element is given and selection is empty or has multiple elements, state is unchanged.
 *
 * If the element does not exist on the current page, state is unchanged.
 *
 * If the element is background element, state is unchanged (you can't reorder the background).
 *
 * Element is given by id and must be moved to the given position.
 * The position can either be a number from 0 to the number of elements, or a string
 * equal to one of the constants: FRONT, BACK, FORWARD, BACKWARD.
 *
 * FRONT is the same as moving to the highest possible number. BACK is the same as moving to 0.
 *
 * FORWARD and BACKWARD is changing the elements relative position by plus or minus 1 respectively.
 *
 * If there is a current background element, both BACK and position 0 is treated as position 1.
 *
 * If element is already at the desired position, state is unchanged.
 *
 * If group is set to a specific id, that id is enforced and will be copied to group.
 * If group is set to null or undefined, group is required to not be present and will be removed.
 * If group is unset or set to false, group will be ignored whether set or not and will not be changed or removed.
 *
 * Selection and current page is unchanged.
 *
 * TODO: Handle multi-element re-order when UX and priority is finalized.
