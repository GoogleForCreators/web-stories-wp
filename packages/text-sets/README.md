# Text sets

This package contains the text sets used by the editor.

## Generating images for text sets

_Note: This script requires the development environment to be running with `DISABLE_OPTIMIZED_RENDERING` so the text sets are rendered as components not images._

Run `node src/cli.js` then move and commit the images to the static-site branch.
