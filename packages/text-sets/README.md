# Text sets

This package contains the text sets used by the editor.

## Generating images for text sets

_Note: This script requires the development environment to be running with `DISABLE_OPTIMIZED_RENDERING` so the text sets are rendered as components not images._

Run `npm run workflow:render-text-sets` to generate and save text sets images in the `build/text-sets/` folder.
Then move and commit the images to the [googleforcreators/wp.stories.google](https://github.com/googleforcreators/wp.stories.google) repo.
