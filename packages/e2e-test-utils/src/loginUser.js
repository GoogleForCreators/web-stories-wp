 * Puppeteer appears to sometimes have issues with typing,
 * where the first 1-2 characters are simply not typed.
 *
 * At the same time, there can be an issue where the password is not actually
 * submitted (not part of the form data) when trying to log in.
 *
 * Hence not using only `page.type()` as one would typically use, but instead
 * using two methods just to be safe.
 *
 * The matchers at the end try to catch any errors where form submission
 * is incomplete for some reason.
