/**
 * Custom helper function to publish posts in Gutenberg.
 *
 * Avoids using `disablePrePublishChecks`.
 *
 * The main reason for this is that it calls toggleScreenOption,
 * which itself is rather flaky and sometimes
 * doesn't find the requested element, causing JS errors.
 *
 * Also avoids using the original `publishPost` helper as it often
 * fails waiting for a snackbar message to appear.
 * Instead, we wait to receive the post's updated permalink.
 *
 * @see https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/blob/f96bd6b6fdfca02d47edce8c2f0d68dccf3a37be/packages/e2e-test-utils/src/toggle-screen-option.js#L20-L23
 * @return {Promise<string>} The post's permalink.
